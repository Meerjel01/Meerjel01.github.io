        <p>
        I've always asked for fanart of my work but never really get it at all. Probably because I'm staying away from asking, or because of fear. I say both.<br>
        <br>
        People do weird, scary and terrible things to other artists work and characters and even if they will tolerate it, I won't. I don't want fetish art. I don't want porn of my characters. I don't want hate art with my characters or involving my work. I simply can't tolerate fanart most of the time. If not now then I will try to live without it later. I'm also used to not getting anything much in return for making my work.<br>
        <br>
        If I ever get a larger name, I respect that you want to show your love to my work and characters. But please don't show me it cause I'm not tolerating everything.<br>
