        Morna is something I've come up with far in the past and still used it in my projects years later. It was supposed to be featured in an real-time strategy game during my high-school days. I don't remember all details of that game except it was heavily Battle Realms influenced.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Morna power is (As I consider it) Future magic. It's usable by any smart creature that wields it and can be used to slighty bend reality and conjure up elements. These creatures that wields Morna is called a Mornalist. Quite similar to the old 'magicka' thingy right? Haven't gotten to figure out how to develop it correctly yet. It resides in an entire Universe, everywhere on a universe which makes it a "Mornaverse". However each of these universes has a place with the most Morna and IS the origin of the Universe's energy. A Morna Core wields the energy itself and are making new energy all the time. Energy being Morni (Positive) or Murno (Negative).

        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Mornalists</h1>
        <p>
        In order to perform Mornalistic abilities, one has to be born with it or find a large amount of absorbable energy in something like a Power Well or another Mornalist that is enough powerful to sacrifice some of it's own without losing too much. Mornalists can alter reality slightly, heal and destroy what they want and spawn creations from another realm or even create their own.<br>
        <br>
        I made some Mornalist types that's worth mentioning. Like<br>
        <br>
        <br></p><p>
        <b><p style="text-align:center;">Glyphlings</b><br></p>
        A glyph is some kind of stone molded with Morna. (What it actually is I haven't looked up yet) It can have any kind of Morni/Murno in it and can be used by any creature that knows how to activate it. Mornalists or not. A Glyphling is usually tasked to make glyphs out of a selected amount of their own energy. Making their job nearly deadly to themselves. They can not only Glyph making but also knows certain abilities like dismornify and energy ball and also Mornify themselves to cast these abilities with more effect. However to be a Glyphling you must not only know how to be a Mornalist but also be able to regenerate energy<br>
        <br></p><p>
        <b><p style="text-align:center;">Spinxer</b><br></p>
        A sort of Guardian for artifacts that knows the ways of turning harmless objects into deadly weapons. They're all about the spikes and could even transform enemies into stone at will. They're mostly focused on combat rather than supporting others but it's rare to get them into wars because of their clean dedication to protect their most valued items. Spinxers who don't have any treasure to protect are called Broken Spinxers.<br>
        <br>
        (A note. It can happen that I mistake Spinxers for some priest type. But Spinxers are mostly an example like the others.)<br>
