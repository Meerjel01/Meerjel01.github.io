        <p>
            You paid attention to my work in awhile? Then you would've figured out that I want to make a game based of Marc Laidlaw's Prospero game that never went off.<br>
            <br>
            Knowing what it truly is isn't easy and I don't know what it was about expect for what is written by Valve or the searching fandom, so I had to make my own ideas to develop from. I've mailed Marc about it but doubt that an answer will be given since he probably doesn't want to tell about Valve stuff anymore. But if I did get an answer, an open one, I would tell him my plans and ask for ideas from him. Maybe get something interesting from this.<br>
            <br>

        <br>
        Uno-Prospero (Unofficial Prospero) is my version of the cancelled Valve game. Set in the 4000s following Aleph in her mission to save the connected worlds from an evil force. With the library she can travel to other dimensions that humans got too and that was untouched. The human race in this age has no guns but uses PSI that they learned generations ago.<br>
        <br>
        No matter if there was so little and no matter how it turned out, I was interested in doing my own version of this. I want to give it life that it didn't deserve at first and I grew fond of the project after a long time of thinking about it. Hopefully I can get a game going after all the ideas I have in store for it. 3D or 2D.<br>
