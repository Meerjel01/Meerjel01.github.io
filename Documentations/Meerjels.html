            This is the doc of the Meerjel specie. A specie I wish to be.<br>
            <br>
            A Meerjel is a small, peaceful flying space creature made of energy and small organs. They don't need air and has can travel in vacuum quick and easily. The energies they possess can be used for a multitude of different things such as defense, maintenance or fun. They come in huge groups and are chatting a lot with their tiny holes. They produce more Meerjels by 2 sharing their energies and molding existing meat with it. It's more common for Meerjels with higher relationships to do this.<br>
            <br>
            The Meerjels have giant, advanced structures floating about in space that they use for living in and doesn't need to pay to live their lives. In fact, they don't even have an economy. Just like in their nature, everything is free for them. Without freedom they wouldn't survive. Meerjels have jobs such as Engineers, Warriors, Nursers and Hierarchs. A faction of Meerjels will have a King or Queen leading them and takes responsibility over their subjects actions. And even for how advanced they are, their technological advancement is static.<br>
