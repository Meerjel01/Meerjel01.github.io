        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Money Doesn't Exist</h1>
        <br>
        And it's true. It's an insane thought but it's also true. I refuse to believe money's really needed.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        To put it. We invented money (SEK, DOLLAR, EURO) to give and receive other things. It had its uses, as we thought to ourselves. But the truth is that these coins and currencies are completely useless. They serve no physical use except for scratching lottery tickets. Rather than that you can just trade actual objects with nearby people for other useful objects. That was what we did before money and after living with money we can't.<br>
        <br>
        Money is also too addicting. Corrupting people and making them only want more. This is why corruption is a thing in the government, might as well be the reason the government exists. You can argue that money brought some interesting stuff to us but there's always other ideas from different people. We lived with money for so long that we depend on it to live at all. It's also why equality doesn't exist, only greed. We could had other things if we stood away from it. Maybe not as advanced but shortcuts doesn't pay off like this.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We're not in control of our money, it's in control of you.<br>
