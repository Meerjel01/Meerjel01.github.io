        Kevinish of Sweden. Young adult and weird. Wants to be a cartoonist and tell my stories even if I imagine them instead of working on them.<br>
        <br>
        This entry was changed. I no longer work in my old workplace (Since they almost ruined my life) and I have more grudges on things by time. I'm just the usual autism guy with bad habits and listens to music all the time. Plus, people around me are disturbing me a lot in my work so I lose a lot of confidence on my art.<br>
        <br>
        There's really a lot to tell about me. But I don't know myself that well.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for reading about me.<br>
