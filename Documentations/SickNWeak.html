        <br>
        This isn't an emo document for myself but to tell one of the many things wrong with our society.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Laziness.<br>
        <br>
        You might not like the name but it's true no matter how you claim it. Some or even most citizens in this world is too tired to do what we usually do. Like preparing for a day, write text with a pen, get a modded console to play and develop for (Couldn't help it) or even lift a bucket. Empty or not! This isn't what we're supposed to be and it's not a change to go with.<br>
        <br>
        We where born in the wilderness and grew up by hunting and running around and in it. The things we do currently makes us lazy that is even affecting myself. There's barely any life in this once man shaped world and it's turning worse for each day. There's a reason you're sad. You're following the wrong path and you need to take the other that your ancestors took.<br>
