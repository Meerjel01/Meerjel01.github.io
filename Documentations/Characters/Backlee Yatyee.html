        Story:<br>
        </p>
        The good artist which Backlee is started in a young age. He lived with religious parents and loves to draw animals. His father was a priest but also selective with what he want his son to be. Ollewo (The father) wanted Backlee to learn how to be a priest and to pray. Backlee was more determined to paint rather than to believe but Ollewo was too strict to let him. When he took away Backlee's art tools, Backlee ran away to become an artist. He left his little home town and got to the big city. Altho he finally got to the city, he was alone.<br>
<br>
He wasn't dumb, he took small jobs and helped others in exchange for money. He brought a painting set and started practicing again. When he became good he started to sell his art for a living and became enough wealthy to get a house (A small one). He lived good. Until he found out what happened to his parents. According to the news the Yatyee couple died by a fire. This made Backlee feel terrible and guilty. He thought that it was his fault that they're dead and was later on in depression.<br>
<br>
While depressed he couldn't do anything. He was never in the mood to paint or to help until he lost everything and lived on the streets. He lived there till one Raxick came over and put him on an orphanage where he then got adopted. His new family, the Doxins was artists themselves but Backlee stopped caring about art. Then they got him back on his feet and he started drawing again. He learned that his past parents couldn't have died because of him and was happy again. He even wanted to be a priest for certain times to have use of what his father taught him.<br>
<br>
As an adult he became noticeable for his art. He even learned history from the Doxins and learned of all other painters in the Raxick timeline. Some of them could be priests as well, so maybe father Ollewo was an artist as well.<br>
