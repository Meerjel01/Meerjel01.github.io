        Story:<br>
        </p>
        She wasn't poor in the past. Misaloizy had a husband called Zoido and a baby daughter called Perli. She had an average amount of money and a job at a gardening facility so she lived as a common and good citizen. One day Zoido got caught with a deadly disease and wasn't allowed to meet his family until he died. He did however have a word with Misaloizy before he passed. After that, Misaloizy lived alone with her baby and struggled more with life than before.<br>
<br>
        Until one day a candle accident happened. Her house and belongings burned down and what was left was herself and Perli. She had no home and barely anything to support her daughter with. She was forced to give her away to one of her old friends called Eliyra who was rich and uncaring. However when Misaloizy begged for her to take care of Perli, Eliyra finally saw pity and adopted the baby after Misaloizy kissed her daughter goodbye.<br>
<br>
        Misaloizy lived on the streets as a hobo now. Pushed away by more fortunate Raxicks and where moving a lot. She grown to be more depressed than before and got more scared and nervous as time passed by. She couldn't even trust the other homeless. She saw no hope for herself until she got to the city forest where she grew happier in. She couldn't stay there but she will sometimes revisit it if she needed it the most. (Which is happening a lot)<br>
