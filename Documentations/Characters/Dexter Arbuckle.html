        Story:<br>
        </p>
        The little maggot called Dexter wasn't like the other Lieros. While most Lieros prefer violence over reason, Dexter was mostly depending on diplomacy to win. He was a skilled spokesman but also a bad fighter. Whenever he's in a fight he's dependent on words to skip conflict and when it wasn't enough he would become bruised or lucky to live in the end.<br>
        <br>
        He have 2 brothers. The biggest one is called Mingel, a semi-rude fellow who acts a lot like a bully to the others. The youngest one is called Bobby, a more lazy Liero who can run real fast and prefers cowardness over fighting. During the end of bullying sections with Mingel, Dexter went over to Bobby to chat. Bobby was a cosmologic nerd so he always has something to tell his medium older brother about space and such. Dexter couldn't talk to Mingel about anything. Mingel was "Born differently".<br>
        <br>
        When Bobby was 18 it was his time to be graduated. Dexter was 21 that time and Mingel was 26. And Mingel killed Bobby before his big day. Dexter got mad over Mingel and tried to kill him. It ended with Dexter not being lucky at all. Mingel ran off to kill some more Lieros and left Dexter alive and crippled on the floor to die bleeding. Dexter was waiting for the end, which never came. God found him and healed him. It told Dexter that he didn't deserve to die yet and gave him a chance to be immortal. But first he had to chose what type of Demi-god Dexter would want to be.<br>
        <br>
        Dexter was tired of the violent earth, so he wished he was traveling through space to find joy. He was granted flight, vacuum breath, electricity bending, ability copying and eternal life. Dexter left earth and went out to the stars where he still is in. Gathering information but getting less and less better at speeking. As no one understood english.<br>
