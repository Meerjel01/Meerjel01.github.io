        <br>
        This is a document addressing a common issue with aliens in the media. We're definitely used by humanoid aliens in our fiction and grew to it. But it's also a reason to blame for it limiting our creativities on what aliens could look like in actuality. We have never seen real aliens but they can't be what we believe them to be. A generic gray guy? Xenomorph? Unless they originated from Humans, used Human genes or are based off us, there's little reason that they could be human formed in most places in the endless.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        There's a whole universe out there with it's own species and possible civilizations. It is difficult to find anything remotely humanoid nearby or anywhere in the galaxy we live in. They simply don't need our Humanoid bodies to find use for tools or be sentient. And for other planets who have their own ecosystem makes the lifeforms in them evolve differently from our home world. Earth aren't everywhere, we have the planet alone.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Although it's just fiction and doesn't need this type of logic, it is an idea to think about and to explore. It has possibilities on what could look like what and what these aliens could do to get so far as to build spacecrafts. The human imagination doesn't need to be limited to our anatomy alone, neither will it offend any aliens that comes to our home world. If they come to us.<br>
