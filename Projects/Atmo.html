        Atmo is a Stand and shoot game for the Xbox Series X/S that is based on Valve's game Prospero that unfortunatelly got canceled in favor for Quiver, which then turned into Half-Life. It isn't know much about Prospero, but I guess it was extremely similar to the newer Quiver.<br>

        A tormented girl named Piik from the far stretching future wakes up from stasis inside an abandoned research facility owned by the Xin corporation. Piik was forced into psi research and there for can use psi to fight and solve riddles where average humans can't use psi at all. She's a unique specimen and are wanted for her psionic abilities. The corporation wont stop until she's captured and reused as a test subject for their heinous research.<br>

        Switched to Xbox. Sucks that it couldn't get to be on the N3DS. It could have had uses of the touch screen.<br>

        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot2.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        It's currently using the Universal Windows Platform settings to run on the console but is gonna be exclusive for the Xbox in the future. I've just began remaking the first level which is gonna be more detailed than the previous. (Better hardware and such)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev2:<br>
        Reimplemented the attack ability and other small things back to the game.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot3.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev3:<br>
        Forgot to update. Sorry. The first level is nearly finished and I am planing on working on the 2nd level simultaneously.<br>

        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot10.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        Terminals are gonna be featured in the game for giving out information and interactivity.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot11.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev4:<br>
        The 1st level can transition to the 2nd level decently. Trigger-Based-Climbing makes a return as well and Finite-State-Machines is gonna be readded.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot12.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        Gonna try force myself into making sprites for new and existing characters<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev5:<br>
        Most of the project's code have been reworked on for optimization. Here's an image of one of the test maps.<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Dev6:<br>
        Worked on the Xin9 Security Guard's sprites and will test him in the game soon.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Xin9_Sec Rotating.gif" alt="Broke Image" width="10%" height="10%" class="center"></img><br>
        Notice the gun? It's a sample weapon! This is how it actually looks like!<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Prilk Handgun(Complete).png" alt="Broke Image" width="5%" height="5%" class="center"></img><br>
        The pickup sprite for the Handgun.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev7:<br>
        Small update. Got some sprites for the first rebel variant done and are hoping on continuing with it.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev8:<br>
        The Xin9 Security Guard can wield a handgun and a medium gun now.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev9:<br>
        Game is still in development. Made some graphics for another enemy type and are planning on changing the area work with more fitting textures.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev10:<br>
        Revealing an enemy from the game. The Synthman.

        Dev11:<br>
        Making sprites is a chore. Even with 2 directions to draw it's difficult. But I will still try to finish this no matter what I think.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev12:<br>
        The first glimpse of Atmo's gameplay was sent to YouTube! <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbGVqAUWBGw">YouTube link</a><br>
        I've remade the game and it's scripts so it's easier to work with and is hopefully more optimized than the previous build. Gonna remake the levels as well with more details and new textures.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Atmo Shot14.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        It looks more different than it did before since it has no normal mapping but the change was to make the environment work with the sprites more.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev13:<br>
        The first 2 guns has been added to the list of available weapons and an inventory system for it has been made in the past (Excuse me for not saying that previously). Had improved it with UI integration today and automatic guns are possible in my code.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev14:<br>
        There's gonna be terminals in the game which the player can read through. This is one of them, a Sci-Doc.<br>

        <p style="color:#71FF9A">Siikish DaggerWalkers<br>
            The DaggerWalkers of Siika is a small-life predator and one of the more common carnivores in the wilderness. They hunt in packs most of the time but one can go out alone for practice, curiosity and out of hunger. They communicate with each others by emitting sorted clicking and sometimes body language. With them chatting a lot and by examining their mind structure we figured most (If not all) of them are extremely talkative. They have energetic fangs that should be used for firing at targets at a distance but most of them don't have this ability. There's 2 types of DaggerWalkers.<br>
            <br>
            [ Minors ]<br>
            The most common type of a DaggerWalker pack. The most common DaggerWalker is in a height between 24 and 28 centimeters and rarely higher or lower.<br>
            <br>
            [ Majors ]<br>
            A more uncommon type but stronger than the minors. They're bigger, tougher, more experienced and can use their energetic abilities. They serve as pack leaders and aren't easier to scare away than the other type.<br>
            <br>
            We've had trouble getting them away from the facility thanks to their evolved curiosity for human beings since awhile back, which is more of an annoyance than an opportunity since we already know enough about them. They even attract Acid-Hounds as DaggerWalkers are a favored delicates of theirs. Rather than that they're pretty harmless to us. We even proved that they can be pets at one point until they turned too hostile for it.<br>

        I also added proper lighting to sprites so the trigger method is not a primary solution now.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev15:<br>
        A new demo video has been released on YouTube.<br>

        Forgot to update the project page. Sorry!<br>
        The game is still worked on. Had finished 3 Scientist sprite-sets and are working on the 4th one today. (19 maj)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dev17:<br>
        Went back to work on the first story level a bit.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Atmo shot15.png" alt="Broke Image" width="60%" height="60%" class="center"></img><br>
        Also fixed an issue with the character flinching even with high protection.<br>
