        Atmo is a Stand and shoot game for the Xbox Series X/S that is based on Valve's game Prospero that unfortunatelly got canceled in favor for Quiver, which then turned into Half-Life. It isn't know much about Prospero, but I guess it was extremely similar to the newer Quiver.<br>

        A tormented girl named Piik from the far stretching future wakes up from stasis inside an abandoned research facility owned by the Xin corporation.

        Switched to Xbox. Sucks that it couldn't get to be on the N3DS. It could have had uses of the touch screen.<br>

        It's currently using the Universal Windows Platform settings to run on the console but is gonna be exclusive for the Xbox in the future. I've just began remaking the first level which is gonna be more detailed than the previous. (Better hardware and such)<br>
