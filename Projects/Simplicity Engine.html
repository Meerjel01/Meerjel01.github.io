        Simplicity is a snit more different than the Atmos Engine (Which will be saved for later). Rather than 3D models it'll have 8 directional sprites. It's a first person game which is built from DirectX 8. This is gonna be a gift to the homebrew community and the fans of the OG Xbox. An easy to mod engine with a limited but good community.<br>
        <br>
        The game is downloadable as a demo/prototype. Featuring map loading from a single file, map geometry with diffuse and lightmap support, sprite placing and up and down look.<br>

        Instructions will be added later. Until then you can look up the media files and figure out how things work for yourself.<br>
