        Jeeme is another game for the Nintendo 3DS and are starring (If you didn't know) Jeeme. A female Pau'Karrfa worker who's unsure about her strength but are infact a carrier of something she never believed in.<br>
        <br>
        Surely you've read the documentaries about the Pau'Karrfa and Morna. If you haven't then read those if you want to understand this game more. It is a Mornaverse, Sci-Fi quality game that I'm meant to finish. Before the 3DS goes away. And if you still didn't know what theme it's gonna have by the background and music then you're not living the same life as me.<br>
        <br>
        It is Bungie related! You might think it's just Halo influenced, but this game is actually a tribute to Bungie's glory. The theme is Marathon and Halo like but the game isn't a first person shooter. It is something I would call "Real Simple Quality" if I wanted to. A top-down 2D progressive RPG. I would rather want it as something else but I'm not entirelly sure how much time I have left before it's too late.<br>
