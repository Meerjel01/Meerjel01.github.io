        Atmos is the name of a first person homebrew engine for the original Xbox. Writen in C++ using DirectX 8.<br>
        <br>
        It is a retro engine for fans of the console and are one of my hobbies. It's name comes from the word "Atmosphere" which will be a major theme for the games which will be produced from this engine. (Unless someone wants something else)<br>
        <br>
        Atmos will have what is available for the first Xbox. Textured maps with lightmapping support, 3D models, face texture management and more. There's gonna be a facial system which bestows of texture swapping which will be used instead of the usual shapes key method.<br>
        <br>
        What I want to implement is LOD and frustum/occlusion culling. But I'm also gonna add a visibility group system to hide certain meshes when triggered. currently collision is the highest priority for the engine.<br>

        There's specific games that I wanted to make from this. I'm not gonna spoil it now but I got ideas from certain sources. One of them is this.<br>
