        This is a 2D Xbox Series S|X game featuring an old top-down style that I wanted to do for a long time. It is set in space where a scientifically advanced specie called Gritters are in war with a race called Kaoms who enslaved the Gritter's allies in the past.<br>
        <br>
        Currently the game is in early development but should be easy to work with. The player is controlling a Major Gritter Warrior called Goulger who's sent to a Kaom colonized planet to help conquer it for the safety of his specie.<br>

        <br>
        The game will also feature coop and multiplayer with split screen support.<br>
