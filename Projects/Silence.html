        The Silence is a point and click game for the Nintendo 3DS that is based on Valve's game Prospero that unfortunatelly got canceled in favor for Quiver, which then turned into Half-Life. It isn't know much about Prospero, but I guess it was extremely similar to the newer Quiver.<br>

        The story involves a gymnastic and mute clone named The Silence who had been inside a cryo for a couple of years in another dimension. When she wakes up her memory's gone, she's weakened and she's in an abandoned facility owned by the Swedish Tritorial Corporation. With help from a survivor that lived through the cataclysm, Silence are on her way to take the most functional teleport off the alien world and to the now high-tech Earth that she never got a chance to live in. But in the end something sinister is going on in the neighboring worlds and Silence are forced to fight the Tritorial Corp's most fatal flaws and save humanity from the alien life that seeks to absorb them.</p>

            It might have taken a long time and a person would suggest that I've been working on this. But the current state of the game is.. Far from finished. I have environment images ready for the very beginning and some references of Unne Labs, but rather than that it's really early in development, even if it isn't. I'm lazy and unfocused and need to think that this project is the only project I'm working on. Really need more motivations for this and I also has doubts that the released game would work as I thought it would. It's simple and barely challenging to make assets for. But I've come some inches away so I might continue.<br>
