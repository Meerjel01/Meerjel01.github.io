        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello</h1>
        <p><br>
        Hello is a fan-game of the MacWorld Halo-Alpha. It's for the Xbox Series S and are not gonna be published unless allowed to.<br>
        <br>
        This is a game that I will work on and post updates on for fun. A hobby game where I make a basic, simple game that in hopes will get me somewhere. It was thought of when I was thinking of the type of Lego that I did a couple of times. A cylinder with a head is what it is!<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        It is not gonna be a full copy of Halo as it was. Some elements will be edited and some are already changed. The iconic Spartans is now HFC-Troopers (HFC: Heavy Field Combat) and the Covenant are renamed the Sangeli Empire. Elites/Sangeli(Name based of the Elite's specie name) owns the mean faction and have a Warrior type as a lesser class.<br>
        <br>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Elite</p>

            <br>
            I will make my own universe from this, but I will also as traditional with the materials as much as I can. There's gonna be vehicles, machetes, giant aliens and as much as I can give to it! It'll stay with me until it's legal (If ever legal) and it'll be my safe haven for my imagination.<br>
            <br>
            Let's see how much I can add.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Combat was added later on. Quite basic, but works fine for now.<br>
