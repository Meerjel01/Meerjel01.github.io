        This is a game that's gonna be used to develop the mechanics for my Happysoft games. It's about hovering worm people with energetic abilities.<br>
        <br>
        The mechanics of this game is stand and shoot based. A third person game with 8 directional movement, 4 directional angular sprites and auto aim based combat. This "Stand and Shoot" gameplay is based on the fact that first person barely works with a controller. (Altho a controller would be more challenging and productive than a mouse and keyboard) It's simplistic to the fullest and are a game that's supposed to be a true game.<br>
        <br>
        To clarify when it comes. This game is to build everything that I need to develop games. This page is to show it to everyone and to give insight of how my games should be.<br>
