        Glow is a Marathon scenario meant to be an unexpected but easy for me to make campaign. It's influenced by and based of Marathon Lost Lands which I yet have to finish. The game has a new (Or so) AI named Mea who's the main guidance for the game's protagonist, Soldat.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/Mea.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"><br>
        Mea the AI<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The player will be in Human ships, on a planet and on a strange alien realm to fight the Pfhor and another rampant AI.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The music will bestow of music like the page's own track. Most by Tineidae. But that depends if the future says differently.
