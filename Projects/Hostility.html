        Hostility is a turn-based strategy game for MacOS X computers with little story to it.<br>
        <br>
        The game rules are near identical to some tabletop wargames out there. When selecting a unit you can move them 1 square at a time until it's move points depletes. Attacking is similar, select a unit and click on an enemy to fire at it. There's melee and ranged but will have artillery and spray attacks during development.<br>

        More information will be available later on.<br>
