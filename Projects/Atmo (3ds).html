        <p><br>
        Atmo is a Stand and shoot game for the Nintendo 3DS that is based on Valve's game Prospero that unfortunatelly got canceled in favor for Quiver, which then turned into Half-Life. It isn't know much about Prospero, but I guess it was extremely similar to the newer Quiver.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        A tormented girl named Piik from the far stretching future wakes up from stasis inside an abandoned research facility owned by the Xin corporation. Piik was forced into psi research and there for can use psi to fight and solve riddles where average humans can't use psi at all. She's a unique specimen and are wanted for her psionic abilities. The corporation wont stop until she's captured and reused as a test subject for their heinous research.<br>

        Dev1:<br>
        The game had been in the works for some time now and I have some screenshots of it.<br>

        I've added an attack to the player. Piik can summon explosive energy at objects or enemies.<br>

        <img src="Atmo/Screenshot9.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"></img>

        <img src="Atmo/Screenshot11.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"></img>
        Also decided to use cutout sprites so the depth doesn't mess up.<br>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Dev3</h1>
        Added an idle animation to Piik and detailed the level a bit.<br>
        <img src="Atmo/Screenshot12.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"></img>
        <img src="Atmo/Screenshot13.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"></img>
        <img src="Atmo/Screenshot14.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center"></img>
        Also the sprites aren't cutouts anymore.<br>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Dev4</h1>
        A save system is in the works. Also tried the cutout method again with no success.<br>
        Why cutout sprites?<br>

        (Floor was gonna have a transparent material so reflections was gonna show inspired by Timesplitters 2)<br>
        No matter if it takes days to make a dev update, the game is still worked on.<br>
