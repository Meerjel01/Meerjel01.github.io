        New YouTube video has been released! It is the level that I talked about in the previous log!<br>

        I'm not good at voice acting and the females has my voice high pitched to oblivion but I hope it's acceptable. Also has another character named Keh in the end who's gonna have a bigger role in the story than the other characters in the video (Except for Goulger himself of course).<br>
