            Had released a demo for the Nintendo Developer Portal and are awaiting feedback from them. But I shouldn't wait till it's too late. That would be lazy. I need to take back the time I've wasted. Just letting you people know the project isn't dead and are not planed to be dead either. Unless time runs out.<br>
