            I am a kind of a person that tries to be focused on this simple task. However the current state of the game is.. Far from finished.<br>
            <br>
            There's work put in to it like references and the first couple of images for the beginning game. But rather than that I just hope that ther 3DS's lifespam is long enough for me to work with. It would be a shame if it just ended cause my attempts at that Unofficial Prospero game would be in vain. My main goal is clear. The Silence is my highest priority.<br>
