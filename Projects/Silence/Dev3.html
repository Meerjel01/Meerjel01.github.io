            The first cutscene is finally finished! I hope it is cause it took a long time because of me trying to force myself to work on it. But even how much progress I am doing, I'm still worried about how it would turn out. How it would apply to the audience. I don't know if it's gonna get accepted cause of it's quality even if I say it's supposed to not only be the journey of the hero but also the journey of the developer.<br>
            <br>
            Even if it's not perfect, I hope it'll be wonderful and fun enough to play.
