            The game's back in slow production. Currently I'm working on the first cutscene of the game. There was a demo attempt which had a finished video and some walk around that was canned because the main game actually have to have a chance to get made. At-least it was the first steps for the ingame sessions.<br>
            <br>
            The production of the game had been worsened because of my sickness, but I'm not giving up on this just yet.
