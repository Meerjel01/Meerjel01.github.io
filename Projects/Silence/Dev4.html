            Apparently I should have put the cutscene out here to show and not keep it as a surprise. That seem's to be a theme for me. Keeping things for myself till it's time.<br>
            <br>
            So now you'll be glad to know (Pfhorrest of the Pfhorums or someone else in general) that I'm gonna put more of my work out to show my progress. Feedbacks a good thing.<br>
            <br>
            Just saying that the cutscenes are slideshows. Because I don't know if I can animated the game completely without it being too late. I worked on slideshows before so it couldn't be that much of a complete waste.<br>
