        Raxick is the name of an hour long slideshow that's in real need for development. It's about 2 twins going through a ton of emotional challenges (However it will turn like) and are gonna end up in the Marathon universe together with their colony ship and friends.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The twins look like this.<br>

            (Hands are too big gotta admit)<br>
            <br>
            The blue one is called Sky Inter (Skyos Interra). He's the oldest and are a scientist that's not considered the most popular one of his team. And the green one is called Emerald Interra. She's a Sorceress and an active little girl. She's the more liked crew-mate in the colony ship.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Hopefully I'm gonna have the energy to work on this. It would be a shame if it didn't ever get a release.<br>
