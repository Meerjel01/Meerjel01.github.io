                A request for a PvZ fan-character. The first piece of fanart for months!<br>

                <b>Emerald</b<br>
                <img src="fanarts/(InkFury1236) Emerald.jpeg" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="20%" height="20%">By InkFury1236<br>
                    <br>
                    The first request I made on Twitter was for InkFury to draw Emerald from my  Raxick project. He/She didn't think it was good enough so I might just say it here that it doesn't matter if your art doesn't come out as expected. I think the sketchiness made the image. It's what makes it unique and uniqueness is what makes most art good. So you did good even if you don't know it my friend.<br>

                        A surprise piece from someone new! Altho Jerry's not the protagonist anymore (Which I didn't say) he's still getting used for something else.<br>
