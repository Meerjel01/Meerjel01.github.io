        <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the images section! Where you look at images I drew from a past to present time. These pictures can range from original pieces of my own characters and projects to fan art of things like Rayman, imscared and 123 Slaughter Me Street. Date is Swedish by the way. Credits are at the end of each description.<br>
        <br>
        The art-style I use is simple and quite easy to learn. If you want to see better then this place isn't for you. The images are free to download but if you're gonna use them for reviews or other purposes then give credit. Stealing/recolor my work will only get you into trouble.<br>

            His daughter's happy for him.. So where do I begin? I've found this Captain Keyes model on the models resources site, found out that it was rigged and played around with the bones. This was the result.<br>

                An old image based of some other person's art-style who, I guess had changed a-lot since then.<br>
