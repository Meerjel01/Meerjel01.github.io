        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Imagery (5)</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the images section! Where you look at images I drew from a past to present time. These pictures can range from original pieces of my own characters and projects to fan art of things like Rayman, imscared and 123 Slaughter Me Street. Date is Swedish by the way. Images with other's characters or worlds are owned by their rightful creators.<br>
        <br>
        The art-style I use is simple and quite easy to learn. If you want to see better then this place isn't for you. The images are free to download but if you're gonna use them for reviews or other purposes then give credit. Stealing and/or recolor my work will only get you into trouble.<br>

        <a href="images/What You Want.png"><img src="images/What You Want.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>Industrial Max. To be honest early Thing-Thing has the most industrial, simplistic and coolest environments in a person's childhood ever.<br>
