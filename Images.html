        <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the images section! Where you look at images I drew from a past to present time. These pictures can range from original pieces of my own characters and projects to fan art of things like Rayman, imscared and 123 Slaughter Me Street. Date is Swedish by the way. Credits are at the end of each description.<br>
        <br>
        The art-style I use is simple and quite easy to learn. If you want to see better then this place isn't for you. The images are free to download but if you're gonna use them for reviews or other purposes then give credit. Stealing/recolor my work will only get you into trouble.<br>

            This image was a gift to a good friend of mine. She was called SweetMangle103 on DeviantArt and she was a nice little girl who did the art I adore... See the documentations to know what I did to her.<br>

            "My heart for you" This is just a minor shipping image of my British OC Harry Willcraft (How Brity) and HER from the pixelated horror game Imscared. Like Harry was supposed to be shipped with HER to begin with cause I like HER. She's pretty.<br>

                This is not just a WAT piece but also a tribute to Cold Black who's music got my Prospero idea to stay alive for weeks. The background is a recreation of their album "Circles" which is the first Cold Black album I've ever heard.<br>

                    A Rayman OC from the past. Was supposed to have his own 3D platformer on the 3DS but is probably not gonna be happening sooner or later. Well at-least he's still alive!<br>

                        And girl. Boy, it was a long time since I've drawn these characters! Almost felt alive again. The Slaughter Me Street community was like home to me back in the past and it's sad that those days are over.<br>

                            The Marathon's onboard AI system which includes the friendly Leela, the sarcastic Durandal and the depressed Tycho. A fan-scenario for Marathon was (Or is) in development which is a cartoon remake of M1 (Marathon 1). But this isn't the place to talk about it so wait for it to appear in the Projects section.<br>
