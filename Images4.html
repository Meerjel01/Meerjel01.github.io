        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Imagery (3)</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the images section! Where you look at images I drew from a past to present time. These pictures can range from original pieces of my own characters and projects to fan art of things like Rayman, imscared and 123 Slaughter Me Street. Date is Swedish by the way. Images with other's characters or worlds are owned by their rightful creators.<br>
        <br>
        The art-style I use is simple and quite easy to learn. If you want to see better then this place isn't for you. The images are free to download but if you're gonna use them for reviews or other purposes then give credit. Stealing and/or recolor my work will only get you into trouble.<br>

        <a href="images/Jewel.png"><img src="images/Jewel.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>This is Jewel. She's a character I made from my school years and was gonna be featured in a game. Now I don't know what to do with her.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Jewel Ready.png"><img src="images/Jewel Ready.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>Get ready for something! I don't know what!<br>
        <a href="images/Not Funny.png"><img src="images/Not Funny.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>It's really not funny! Thought that the previous pupils wouldn't work with the new eye form so I changed it.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/The Itch.png"><img src="images/The Itch.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>The terrible Itch! I might not remember what Jewel was supposed to be.<br>

        <a href="images/What Is This.png"><img src="images/What Is This.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>The head form speaks 'Nja' again.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Nja.png"><img src="images/Nja.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>Different head shape for Jewel! It was just an experiment so it's not a replacement for her. She's also still mouthless.<br>

        <a href="images/Drama Queen Not A-Lot.png"><img src="images/Drama Queen Not A-Lot.png" alt="Broke Image" class="center" width="10%" height="10%"></a>Be no good when die. That's the answer to all.<br>
