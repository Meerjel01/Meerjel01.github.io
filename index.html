        This is Meerjel01 typing. What happened to the site? Whats going on? The answer might be saddening or overal relieveable to some people. Altho I know some people cares, I just wanted to say that I'm going on a long hiatus for relaxation, practice and trying to live newly. I am leaving my social life in all sites for experience and to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm not mad or depressed, I just want to experience some sort of journey outside my isolation and to better myself for my return.<br>
        <br>
        I want to say sorry to those who expected me to succeed on my projects and plans. I wanted too much and that has always been a problem to me. My aim took my likeability for a company everyone loves and made me have too much unfinished work. I where too desperate to succeed, so I'm canceling my plans to find some peace.<br>
        <br>
        I will try my best to keep my promise this time. To stay away and make myself a better man. I did some horrible things that I'm not capable of talking about. I broke people I cared about, I never had friends that lasted long enough. But I will see the light. I know I did good, I know I succeeded on something here. I know I'm a good person. Now might be an ending, but it's a temporary ending. My return will make me different. So I'll end it here by saying, as both a Marathon fan and a space fish..<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        See you starside.
